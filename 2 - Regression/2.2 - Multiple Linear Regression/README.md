# Linear Regration Caviets

## Assumptions of a Linear Regression:
    - Linearity
    - Homoscedasticity (a situation in which the variance of the dependent variable is the same for all the data)
    - Multivariate Normality
    - Independence of Errors
    - Lack of Multicollinearity (Lack of: the occurrence of high intercorrelations among two or more independent variables in a multiple regression model.)
    

Befre building a linear regression model you have to check that this assumtions are true, then you can be sure you are building a good linear model
